    <p>
Self-taught artist of 25 years, Bryce Rigler has taken 4 years of Graphic Arts <br>
in a Bachelors Program, creating elaborate designs. worlds, and creatures for <br>
various clients. He speciallizes in high-concept creature design and <br>
character design! Born in Livingston,MT on August of 95, he was raised off the <br>
fresh wilderness of Montana throughout his life, developing a <br>
fascination with wildlife as a result, as reflected in his science-fiction<br>
sketches of creatures and animals from other worlds. His interest in character <br>
design stems from his life-long love of animation and has come to appreciate how<br>
characters are designed to reflect their personalities!! Though diagnosed with<br>
Duchennes Muscular Dystrophy at age 4, his lack of brawn doesnt<br>
stop him from creating!
