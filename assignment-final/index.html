      His prime expertise and interest
    in his paper art is in creature and character design, developing a fascination of which through media such as Pokemon
    and th Godzilla franchise, creating more then 1000+ similar creatures in the span of a decade! His imagination and fun-going 
    design philosophies show no borders! His appreciation of the natural world and its many intricate parts are another major
    inspiration of his!

    <div class="paragraph1">
        He is still learning the ropes of digital media design, as his prime expertise is in the classic pen and paper, as his entire
        life he is been drawing on such media, refining it each day as he consumes more artistic media, weather that be animation, cgi artistry,
        digital paintings, editing, etc! Never once taking a single art class, Bryce Rigler is completely self-taught and harbors his own 
        techniques seperate then what is taught in art-classes. Though struggles with portraits and realistic proportions, he excels in environment design,
        creature design, and sense of depth!

        Bryce Rigler was diagnosed with Duchennes Musculur Dystrophy at age 4, and has since gradually lost muscle strength and has become more limited in his movements,
        becoming permanently wheelchair bound at age 12. This series of events lead to a man who daydreams and creates in his spare time as a result, evolving into a more capable
        artist throughout the years, eventually growing an interest in the research and study of various artistic mediums, including digital art!
