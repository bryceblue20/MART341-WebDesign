      Strange Alien World

    The drawings down below exhibit the artist's eye for detail and environment design along with his eye for creature design
    that he has worked to refine over the years. This world shows off concepts of biology that differ from Earth, yet are simultaneouly
    familiar to what we know of biology found in our world. Pandora from Avatar was a major inspiration to the animals shown below.

    <h3>
        The World
    </h3>
    <div class="artwork7">
    </div>
    <div class="description">
         <i>This gas giant roughly the size of Saturn takes 8 Earth hours to complete a full rotation on its axis! The year for the gas giant<br>
    takes approximately 500 Earth days! This is one of the few gas giants known to science to sit comfortably in the habitable zone! the <br>
    zone in which water can be sustained without freezing or vaporizing! The planets largest moon, Midamis, supports an enormous array of unusual lifeforms!
    The moon's gravity is incredibly low! Its so miniscule that almost 90 percent of the planets animals have evolved to swim in the air, hover, or float, using specialized <br>
    sacs of hydrogen located within their bodies and fin like organs, wings, or even jet like structures to propel themselves! The planet is also dominated by unusual photosynthesizing <br>
     animals called "Photocnidarians"!so-called because they all resemble hybrids between plant-life and cydarians on Earth such as jellyfish and anemones! They outnumber the plant life on <br>
     this world and very few are capable of locomotion! The planet is almost all forest, dotted by large clearings of grassland and ocean! </i>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph2">
        So obviously similar to Pandora, except I wanted to also think about something truly alien unique to this world while also making sense to biology,
        thus I chose animals with a unique adaptation to the very low gravity and animals that have characteristics of both plant and animal! The moon is named after Midas,
        the story of the king, named Midas, who turns everything he touces into gold, referring to the planet being a rare jewel in the cosmos, a world that can support life!

    <h3>
     Family Bond
    </h3>
    <div class="artwork8">
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <i>A fully matured Staghorn with its infant! The mother must be cautious at all times, as predators can come and attack at any moment! <br> 
            This Midamis inhabitant is roughly the size of a school bus and uses its enormous antlers to threaten or attack territorial intruders <br>
            or deadly predators!
        </i>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph2">
     So it was probably a mistake to set my first drawing in the moon's jungles but was pleasantly surpised with how it turned out, applying a plethora of 
     different creatures, plants, etc scattered all over the place. One can find several interesting things in this one drawing alone!
    <h3>
        A Well-Earned Feast
    </h3>
    <div class="artwork9">
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <i>The deadliest low-ground predator on Midamis, the Whip-Tailed Gnasher, feeds on a common grassland grazer. This predator has two rows of razor-sharp <br>
             teeth that can go through bone with ease and a tail it can whip at other Gnashers for dominance! The darkness of the forest looms deep, making it impossible <br>
             to see the activity crawling inside! But the life in it is quite audible!
        </i>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph2">
        This apex predator was very fun to design, thinking about aerodynamic predators on Earth, such as a Tiger, and applying it into its look!
        Finally, giving it interesting body parts, like its tail, to finalize the creature!
    </div>
    <h3>
    An Ocean in the Sky
    </h3>
    <div class="artwork10">
    </div>
    <div class="description">
      <i>One of Midamis's largest floating animals, the appropriately name Sky Whale is only 5 feet shorter then the Blue Whale on Earth! This incredible animal swims <br>
        in the clouds, feeding on the microscopic fliers,  who in turn feed on large Photocnidarians that also drift in the air,or the giant ones that tower over the clouds <br>
        from the forest canopies! They use there large feathered appendages jutting out of there face to brush any "micro-fliers" into there gaping maw! This particular specimen <br>
         has a group of animals called Dermiskates picking off any parasitic micro-fliers that might be attached to its rubbery skin! The Sky Whale has one of the largest internal hydrogen <br>
         sacs of any Midamin animal!</i>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph2">
        I have taken a lot of Earth ocean animals and adapted them to flying, floating creatures for Midamis, including this creature, that traps tiny, flying creatures for consumption!
