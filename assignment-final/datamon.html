      Fanmade Pokemon-like Characters

    <div class="paragraph2">
    Despite not exhibiting detail or environment design he typically does in his work, his fan-made Pokemon-like
    designs are nevertheless detailed in their inspirations and highly creative, exhibiting multiple concepts. These 
    earlier work pail in comparison to his later designs, but are still unique and visually interesting. These early 
    designs include...
    </div>
    <h3>
        Reef Datamon 
    </h3>
    <div class="artwork">
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <b>Floatmon:</b> <i>Its bowl shaped body gives it a low enough density </br>
        to float atop the waves, leisuring about. It feeds on any organic matter that </br>
         finds itself floating along with it</i>
    </div>

    <div class="description">
        <b>Seaweemon:</b> <i>Now that it is heavier, it uses inflatable sacs on its sides </br> 
            to control its buoyancy.It has perfect camouflage when asleep in a kelp forest.</i>
    </div>

    <div class="description">
        <b>Reefmon:</b> <i>Ocean Datamon loce to build their nests on the reef on its back. </br>
             It lays motionless forlong periods of time until unsuspecting prey swims by.
        </i>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph2">
        I thought the concept of buoyancy and levels of such was an interesting concept, which later evolved into a concept
        of turning into a part Rock type with a Coral motif!
    </div>
    <h3>
     Star Datamon   
    </h3>
    <div class="artwork2">
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <b>Twinklemon:</b><i>Its power can keep a small town lit with electricity for months. Unusually, </br>
            it seems to be heavier and denser then its evolution.
        </i>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <b>Plasmamon:</b><i>Many people used it as a living city generator, but since it is strenuous for it </br>
        to keep up its unlimited power, it is now considered illegal to do so</i>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph2">
     I like to think about unique type combinations and create something that makes sense with such typing, such as a star that exhibits
     both fire and electric characteristics, which again, makes perfect sense!
    </div>
    <h3>
        Adaptive Fish Datamon
    </h3>
    <div class="artwork3">
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <b>Axomon:</b><i>Though blind, it feels around its dark cave home using its touch sensitive nose. </br>
        It can survive weeks without food.</i>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <b>Sailmon:</b><i>it has now adapted for life in the open ocean, completely changing its form. </br>
        It uses its large, wing-like fins to catch ocean currents.</i>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph2">
        Pokemon that completely change when they evolve have always fascinated me, and thus created a Datamon that changes
        when thrust into an unfamiliar different environment!
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph2">
        These next few Datamon are more recent, and have a significant jump in design and concept quality!
    </div>
    <h3>
    Juggernaut Turtle Datamon
    </h3>
    <div class="artwork4">
    </div>
    <div class="description">
      <b>Juggermon:</b><i>It swims the worlds oceans, its massive body treading throught the waves. It carries several Datamon across </br>
        the sea to different locations</i>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph2">
        The Pokemon Lapras (a Plessie like creature with a shell that carries people) has the same concept, but I decided to take the idea to a different level
        and create something more visually interesting and slick!
    </div>
    <h3>
        Wind Dragon Datamon
    </h3>
    <div class="artwork5">
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <b>Vipermon:</b><i>This form of Vipermon has adapted to fly across the Icela Region's enormous mountain chains,</br>
            developing wind abilities as a result! It has a irky disposition.</i>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <b>Wyrmon:</b><i>Gaining the soul and heart of a powerful dragon gave it the powers to create huge cyclones</br>
            capable of destroying neighborhoods. It spends most of its time secluded in mountain caverns and caves.
            </i>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph2">
        This character is based on the classical Chinese dragon, or Wyrm, mixed with a Viper. Regional variants are an idea implemented
        by Pokemon in their seventh generation, and I wanted to do that too, as it take old designes of mine and reworks them with a new
        typing, and a brand-new seperate evolution!
    </div>
    <h3>
        Owl Datamon
    </h3>
    <div class="artwork6"></div>
    <div class="description">
        <b>Vowlmon:</b><i>It keeps track of time by rotating its head in time with the suns movements. Its involvement with the <br>
            sun has fascinated people since long ago.</i>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <b>Ramon:</b><i>They watch over ancient tombs of powerful ancient Datamon and turns to stone those who trespass.</br>
            They have many abilities involving the sun.
        </i>
    </div>
<div class="paragraph2">
    The first form is an owl with the shape of an organ urn Egyptians used to store the organs of mummified pharoahs, whilst the second form
    is based exclusively on the Egyptian sun god Ra. The details and inpiration here is one of my personal favorites!
