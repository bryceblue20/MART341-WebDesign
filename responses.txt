1. Though used interchangeably in everyday conversation, the world wide web and the internet have two clear differences. The Internet is a global interconnected 
network of billions of servers and computers, whilst the World Wide Web refers to the information accessed via the Internet.

2. The internet moves data through its network via servers that are all connected to the internet,all with their own unique security protocol numbers known as IP
addresses, which are read with routers, the "gateways" to the internet and subsequently the world wide web. Home computers use these IP addresses to read sources and allows 
packets of data to move to and fro to one server to another without interference or criss-cross movement. Internet Service Providers are used to connect home computers

3. A directory is a structured pathway of files and folders that indicates the shared relationships and hierarchies they share with one another and allows 
the Github user to navigate the files and folders under the main (root) file.

4. VCS will allow me to share, track, andsave my work whilst also going back on any changes I might have been unsatisfied with!

5. My favorite artform by far is animation! It allows us to create any story, world, character, etc. with the only limit
being one's own talent and creativity!
