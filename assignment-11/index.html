                During the latter half of the post-world war Japan, the country began to struggle to find a visual language to subscribe to in the realm of graphic design, in the midst of a transitional period between <i>more traditional visual flow</i>, to a <i>more modernized, industrial look!</i> This began a disturbing trend in which the country began to blend with national graphic design sensibilities, whilst lacking its own visual identity to give the country a much-needed way to stand out. This was the thought process of the legendary graphic designer <b>Yusaku Kamekura,</b> who is often regarded as the godfather of Japanese graphic design! His personal interest in the research and creation of his work, including what will become one of the most influential pieces of graphic design for a singular country ever conceived, started in the midst of the post-war graphic transitional period in which the nation has immediately began to struggle with when the war ended in 1945!  

                His creations are widely considered by the country to have helped pull them out of the blending appeal of the international market by simply subscribing to their design, and into their own appealing visual identity that still to this day blends into their marketing DNA, whilst still using design philosophies from other countries! His famous designs used in the poster of the<b>1964 Olympic games</b> and the <b>1970 Osaka Expo</b>, mixed his love and interest of western industrial, modernist design, with the more traditional, flowing look of cultural Japan, to extremely successful results. (according to a research international graphic arts survey done by Aaron Liu, he directly answered his question regarding inserting traditional motif, he answers with, <i>“Yes, I do, Because I am a Japanese. However, I try to create something new, it fundamentally has Japanese style.</i>)  
                
                He immediately grabbed the viewers' attention with the fusion of two seemingly different visual appeals! Daria Shumarova on her article on the subject agrees on Kamekura's visual success. <i>“Visual image of the Olympic games in Tokyo is considered as a way of the country’s self-identification in the world and as a step towards national and cultural conscious formation in postwar Japan.”</i> Once more, he was a major contributor to the creation and foundation of the Nippon Design Center in 1960, which is one of, if not the largest graphic design conglomerates in the entire country!
