1. Web-safe fonts are the more default, typical fonts installed on every computer, such as Ariel and Times New Roman, whilst web fonts need to be pre-installed before use! System fonts are the same, except rather then used for font-face declaration in CSS, they are used for applications

2. Fallback fonts are important for use in websites that could not load the main font for whatever reason. Think of it as a backup!
