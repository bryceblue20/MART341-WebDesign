1. Preferably, an html document contains only one head, though it is possible to have two. With the <body> tag, however, their can only always be one! The <head> tag contains the important, unseen elements of the webpage that make it tick, sort of like its "thoughts", such as the viewport and css stylings, while the body contains the actual contents, such as the headings and paragraph tags!!


2. The structurul markup provides the organization of the content, whilest semantic markup is used primarily for emphasis and slight content styling, such as bold and italics
