1. I decided to visit Youtube and how it has changed over the past 11 years, going all the way back to November of 2010! The present day Youtube is much more streamlines, with everybit of navigation found near the top or on the sidebar, whilst 2010 Youtube is a bit more scatter-shot with how it is presented. Every video now is presented in the same size windows, whilst videos such as most popular get there own completely different format, making things appear more disorganized, in my opinion!

2. I feel as though coding isnt as scary a prospect as i initially feared! Its a relatively simple language once you get the hang of it! Moreover, I learned about the existence of a few great apps and sites with VS Code and Github, and overall find the class very enlightening anf fun!
